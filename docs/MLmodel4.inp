TITLE: Multilevel DSEM model 4 with TINTERVAL and THINNING

       Withinevel:
       - no parameters at this level
       
       Between level:
       - two random means and four random slopes and random (log) variances
       - all random effects are indicators of a latent variable

DATA:
    file = MLdata.dat;
    
VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE CL TE N RS time person; 
    USEVARIABLES = CL TE;
    CLUSTER = person;
    LAGGED = CL(1) TE(1);
    TINTERVAL = time(1);

ANALYSIS:   
    TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
    ESTIMATOR = BAYES;
    PROC = 2;
    BITER = (5000);
