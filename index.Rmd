This page contains the __Mplus input and output files__, and the __simulated data files__ that form the basis for the __DSEM demo videos__ that I recorded; you can find the [__playlist__ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA3HvJZDzeo&list=PLet3DgvxBn2S7N2hVW4COAwH3_VaRoujd).

If you have comments about these materials, or suggestions for other videos on DSEM, you can contact me [here](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/ELHamaker).

# Introduction
Dynamics structural equation modeling (DSEM) is based on a combination of time series modeling, multilevel modeling, and structural equation modeling. It can be used to analyze time series data and intensive longitudinal data, such as obtained with daily diaries, ecological momentary assessments, experience sampling, ambulatory assessments, and other techniques that tend to result in (relatively) large numbers of repeated measures (say, more than 20) per case. 

More information about DSEM and how it was implemented in the software package Mplus can be found on the website for our [__DSEM book chapter__](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-book-chapter/), and the [__Mplus website__](https://www.statmodel.com/TimeSeries.shtml).

# DSEM models 
The DSEM demo videos show how to use Mplus to specify specific models, and how to interpret the output. In addition, there will also be videos that focus on various aspects related to DSEM analyses, such as Bayesian estimation and useful plotting options.

## $\blacktriangleright$ Multilevel model
The simulated data that are used in the DSEM demo videos on multilevel models can be found [__here__](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLdata.dat).

### Part 1: Basic dynamic multilevel models

Several __basic dynamic multilevel models__ are discussed in the part 1 videos, with one focusing on the [__input__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6-QNQ-3iR4&list=PLet3DgvxBn2S7N2hVW4COAwH3_VaRoujd&index=3), and the other focusing on the [__parameter estimates__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD6F8TbT5_E&list=PLet3DgvxBn2S7N2hVW4COAwH3_VaRoujd&index=4).

The models covered include:

* __Model 1__: random means; non-random slopes and non-random residual variances (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel1.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel1.htm))

* __Model 2__: random means and random slopes; non-random residual variances (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel2.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel2.htm))

* __Model 3__: random means, random slopes, and residual variances that covary (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel3.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel3.htm))


<br>

### Part 2: More advanced dynamic multilevel models


More __advanced dynamic multilevel models (with structural equation modeling at the between level)__ are discussed in the part 2 videos, with one focusing on the [__input__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q6wljmgwh0&list=PLet3DgvxBn2S7N2hVW4COAwH3_VaRoujd&index=5), and the otehr focusing on the [__parameter estimates__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTKeLe6AX-A&list=PLet3DgvxBn2S7N2hVW4COAwH3_VaRoujd&index=6).

Models that are discussed in these videos---and models that are closely related to them---are:

* __Model 4__: random means, slopes, residual variances which are indicators of a latent variable (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel4.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel4.htm))

* __Model 5__: random means, slopes, residual variances which are predicted by a level 2 predictor that is grand mean centered (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel5.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel5.htm))

* __Model 5 (noncentered)__: random means, slopes, residual variances which are predicted by a level 2 predictor that is NOT centered (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel5_noncentered.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel5_noncentered.htm))

* __Model 5 (nocov)__: random means, slopes, (log) residual variances which are predicted by a level 2 predictor that is grand mean centered, with the residual covariance between the person specific means on CL and TE fixed to zero (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel5_nocov.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel5_nocov.htm))

* __Model 5 (rescov)__: random means, slopes, (log) residual variances which are predicted by a level 2 predictor that is grand mean centered, with the residual covariance all estimated freely (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel5_rescov.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel5_rescov.htm))

* __Model 6__: random means, slopes, (log) residual variances which are predicted by a level 2 predictor and that predict a level 2 outcome (Mplus [input](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/MLmodel6.inp) and [output](https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-demo-videos/mlmodel6.htm))

(NB: There are some very minor differences in the output provided here for models 5 and 6 compared to the results in the video; I used PROC=2 here, whereas PROC=4 for these models in the video.)
