This page will contain the Mplus input and output files, and the simulated data files that are used for the DSEM demo videos.


# Introduction
Dynamics structural equation modeling (DSEM) is based on a combination of time series modeling, multilevel modeling, and structural equation modeling. It can be used to analyze time series data and intensive longitudinal data, such as obtained with daily diaries, ecological momentary assessments, experience sampling, ambulatory assessments, and other techniques that tend to result in (relatively) large numbers of repeated measures (say, more than 20) per case. 

More information about DSEM and how it was implemented in the software package Mplus can be found here: https://ellenhamaker.github.io/DSEM-book-chapter/ and here: https://www.statmodel.com/TimeSeries.shtml.

 

# Topics 
The DSEM demo videos show how to use Mplus to specify specific models, and how to interpret the output. In addition, there are also videos that focus on various aspects related to DSEM analyses, such as Bayesian estimation and plotting options.
